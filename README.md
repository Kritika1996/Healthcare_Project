# Healthcare_Project
Health care insights project
This project aims to build an interactive analytics dashboard using Python, SQL, and Streamlit, providing insights into patient demographics, treatment patterns, and facility utilization. Learners will preprocess a healthcare dataset, integrate it into a database, and create a user-friendly dashboard to support informed decision-making.
